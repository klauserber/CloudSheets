By: AC/DC
Album: TNT
Transcribed by: Russell Edwards roemcs@melb.alexia.net.au

[A]
Riding down the highway
Going to a show
Stop in all the by-ways
Playing rock 'n' roll
Getting robbed
Getting stoned
Getting beat up
Broken boned
Getting had
Getting took
I tell you folks, it's harder than it looks

Chorus:
It's a [A]long way to the [G]top if you wan[D]na rock 'n' [A]roll	x 2
If you [A]think it's easy doing one night stands [D]
Try playing in a rock 'n' roll band
It's a [G]long way to the [D]top if you wanna to rock 'n' [A]roll

Break:
[A]
[G] [D] [A]	x 4

[A]						Quiet
Hotel, motel
Make you want to cry
Lady do the hard sell
Know the reason why
Getting old					Heavy
Getting grey
Getting ripped off
Under paid
Getting sold
Second hand
That's how it goes, playing in a band

Chorus:
It's a [A]long way to the [G]top if you wan[D]na rock 'n' [A]roll	x 2
If you [A]wanna be a star of stage and screen [D]
Look out, it's rough and mean
It's a [G]long way to the [D]top if you wanna to rock 'n' [A]roll	x 4

It's a long way				Repeat & ad-lib
